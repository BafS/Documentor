# Welcome to Documentor documentation

> A super intuitive doc generator from Markdown files

Documentor was made to create a documentation from simple flat markdown files.

The goal of the project is

- To have an easy way to do it
- To embed everything (style, script, images) in a single html file
- To be able to read the documentation without javascript
- To have a simple search engine (if javascript is enabled)
- To be easily customizable
